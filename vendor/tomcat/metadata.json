{"name":"tomcat","version":"2.0.3","description":"Installs and Apache Tomcat and manages the service","long_description":"# tomcat Cookbook\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/tomcat.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chef-cookbooks/tomcat) [![Cookbook Version](https://img.shields.io/cookbook/v/tomcat.svg)](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/tomcat)\n\nProvides resources for installing Tomcat and managing the Tomcat service for use in wrapper cookbooks. Installs Tomcat from tarballs on the Apache.org website and installs the appropriate configuration for your platform's init system.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Platforms\n\n- Debian / Ubuntu derivatives\n- RHEL and derivatives\n- Fedora\n- openSUSE / SUSE Linux Enterprises\n\n### Chef\n\n- Chef 12.1+\n\n### Cookbooks\n\n- compat_resource\n\n## Usage\n\nDue to the complexity of Tomcat cookbooks it's not possible to create an attribute driven cookbook that solves everyone's problems. Instead this cookbook provides resources for installing Tomcat and managing the Tomcat service, which are best used in your own wrapper cookbook. The best way to understand how this could be used is to look at the helloworld test recipe located at test/cookbooks/test/recipes/helloworld_example.rb\n\n## Resources (providers)\n\n### tomcat_install\n\ntomcat_install installs an instance of the tomcat binary direct from Apache's mirror site. As distro packages are not used we can easily deploy per-instance installations and any version available on the Apache archive site can be installed.\n\n#### properties\n\n- `version`: The version to install. Default: 8.0.32\n- `install_path`: Full path to the install directory. Default: /opt/tomcat_INSTANCENAME_VERSION\n- `tarball_base_path`: The base path to the apache mirror containing the tarballs. Default: '<http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/>'\n- `checksum_base_path`: The base path to the apache mirror containing the md5 file. Default: '<http://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/>'\n- `exclude_docs`: Exclude ./webapps/docs from installation. Default true.\n- `exclude_examples`: Exclude ./webapps/examples from installation. Default true.\n- `exclude_manager`: Exclude ./webapps/manager from installation. Default: false.\n- `exclude_hostmanager`: Exclude ./webapps/host-manager from installation. Default: false.\n\n#### example\n\nInstall an Tomcat 8.0.32 instance named 'helloworld' to /opt/tomcat_helloworld_8_0_32/ with a symlink at /opt/tomcat_helloworld/\n\n```ruby\ntomcat_install 'helloworld' do\n  version '8.0.32'\nend\n```\n\n### tomcat_service\n\ntomcat_service sets up the installed tomcat instance to run using the appropriate init system (sys-v, upstart, or systemd)\n\n#### properties\n\n- `install_path`: Full path to the install directory. Default: /opt/tomcat_INSTANCENAME\n- `env_vars`: An array of hashes containing the environmental variables for Tomcat's setenv.sh script. Note: If CATALINA_BASE is not passed it will automatically be added as the first item in the array. Default: [ {'CATALINA_BASE' => '/opt/INSTANCE_NAME/'}, {'CATALINA_PID' => '$CATALINA_BASE/bin/tomcat.pid'} ]\n\n#### actions\n\n- `start`\n- `stop`\n- `enable`\n- `disable`\n- `restart`\n\n#### example\n\n```ruby\ntomcat_service 'helloworld' do\n  action :start\n  env_vars [{CATALINA_PID => '/my/special/path/tomcat.pid'}]\nend\n```\n\n## License & Authors\n\n- Author: Tim Smith ([tsmith@chef.io](mailto:tsmith@chef.io))\n\n```text\nCopyright:: 2010-2016, Chef Software, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n```\n","maintainer":"Chef Software, Inc.","maintainer_email":"cookbooks@chef.io","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{"ubuntu":">= 0.0.0","debian":">= 0.0.0","redhat":">= 0.0.0","centos":">= 0.0.0","suse":">= 0.0.0","opensuse":">= 0.0.0","scientific":">= 0.0.0","oracle":">= 0.0.0","amazon":">= 0.0.0"},"dependencies":{"compat_resource":">= 12.9.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{}}
